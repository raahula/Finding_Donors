## Installation:
This project is based on Python 3.7.0 (default, Jun 28 2018, 08:04:48) running in an anaconda 5.3.0 distribution.

## Summary:
In this project, I will employ several supervised algorithms and then choose one of them to accurately model an individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. My goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can infer this value from other publically available features.

## File descriptions:

This project consists of a workbook and an html file.
Both contain the code in detail.

## Results:
The model performs reasonably well to predict individual's earning more than $50,000.
